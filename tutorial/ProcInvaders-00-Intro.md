# Procedural Invaders

Learn the basics of programming - variables, functions, loops - via the
power of JavaScript and amidst loads of fun, (re-)creating a retro arcade classic:
[Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)!

> ^^Note: Space Invaders^^
> Space Invaders is a classic arcade game, in which you, as the sole Defender of
> Earth try to protect our planet from an alien invasion.  
> In the game, rows of aliens slowly descend from the top of the screen, spewing
: bombs and various other kinds of chaos, while the player controls a lone cannon
> on the bottom of the screen, trying to survive and fend off the invasion by
> shooting the alien hordes off the skies, one by one before they have the chance to
> set foot on our beloved Mother Earth.
